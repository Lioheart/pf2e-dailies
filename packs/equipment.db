Your mind weapon is an extension of your mindâ€”it has no Hardness, and any ability that would damage your mind weapon instead damages you directly, pushing back against the weapon's corporeal form and becoming mental damage of the same amount the weapon would have taken.</p>\n<p>You can project your mind weapon using an <strong>Interact </strong>action, just as you would draw any other weapon. Only you can hold, carry, or wield your mind weapon; if held by another person, it quickly disappears from their hand, reforming in your mind for you to project again. If you're disarmed of your mind weapon, it dematerializes, but you can draw it again with an <strong>Interact</strong> action starting at the beginning of your next turn.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":0},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","otherTags":[]},"quantity":1,"baseItem":null,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"value":0,"max":0},"hardness":0,"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":{}},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","invested":null,"handsHeld":0},"stackGroup":null,"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":null,"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"size":"med","identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"Unusual Weapon","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unidentified_item_icons/weapon.webp","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"category":"martial","group":null,"bonus":{"value":0},"damage":{"dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"slashing","persistent":null},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":0},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":null},"strikingRune":{"value":null},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":0,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null,"criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/disrupting-weapons.webp","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"eYRcJxNtWBHDBCJ8":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e-dailies.equipment.VpmEozw21aRxX15P"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1676226950463,"modifiedTime":1676290103055,"lastModifiedBy":"eYRcJxNtWBHDBCJ8"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"VpmEozw21aRxX15P"}
